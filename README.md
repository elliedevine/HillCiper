# HillCiper
After learning about the Hill Ciper in my mathematics lectures, I thought it would be cool idea to code it and try encrypt my own messages!
This project is in the very early stages and I am trying to figure out all the ins and outs of how to encrypt it.
I want to say that I am referencing GeeksforGeeks on how to structure my overall code as they have a tutorial on the encryption but I wanted to go a step further.
I wanted to try and implement it across different classes and not just in the one file so that I can get a better understanding of Java and to just do some problem solving!
